1
00:00:03,018 --> 00:00:25,348
Thank you very much. Well, I would like to start with testicles. Men who sleep

2
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:31,408
five hours a night have significantly smaller testicles than those who sleep

3
00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:38,498
seven hours or more. In addition, men who routinely sleep just four to five

4
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:41,961
hours a night will have a level of testosterone, which is that of someone

5
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:50,998
ten years their senior. So a lack of sleep will age a man by a decade in terms of

6
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:57,831
that critical aspect of wellness. And we see equivalent impairments in female

7
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:07,863
reproductive health caused by a lack of sleep. This is the best news that I have

8
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:15,563
for you today. From this point, it may only get worse. Not only will I tell you

9
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:19,186
about the wonderfully good things that happen when you get sleep, but the

10
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:23,709
alarmingly bad things that happen when you don't get enough. Both for your

11
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:30,133
brain and for your body. Let me start with the brain and the functions of

12
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:33,192
learning and memory. Because what we've discovered over the past ten or so

13
00:01:33,736 --> 00:01:38,896
years is that you need sleep after learning to essentially hit the save

14
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:44,265
button on those new memories so that you don't forget. But recently we

15
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:49,113
discovered that you also need sleep before learning. And now to actually

16
00:01:50,825 --> 00:01:56,625
prepare your brain, almost like a dry sponge ready to initially soak up new

17
00:01:55,534 --> 00:02:01,014
information. And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain essentially

18
00:02:00,283 --> 00:02:06,363
become waterlogged as it were and you can't absorb new memories. So let me show

19
00:02:06,664 --> 00:02:12,824
you the data. Here in the study, we decided to test the hypothesis that pulling

20
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:20,141
the all-nighter was a good idea. So we took a group of individuals and we

21
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,330
assigned them to one of two experimental groups, a sleep group and a sleep

22
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:29,269
deprivation group. Now the sleep group, they're going to get a full eight hours

23
00:02:28,906 --> 00:02:33,506
of slumber. But the deprivation group, we're going to keep them awake in the

24
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:38,143
laboratory under full supervision. There's no knaps or caffeine, by the way, so it's

25
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:44,295
miserable for everyone involved. And then the next day, we're going to place

26
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:47,242
those participants inside an MRI scanner. And we're going to have them try and

27
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:51,828
learn a whole list of new facts as we're taking snapshots of brain activity. And

28
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:59,475
then we're going to test them to see how effective that learning has been. And

29
00:02:58,616 --> 00:03:03,616
that's what you're looking at here on the vertical axis. And when you put those

30
00:03:03,413 --> 00:03:10,573
two groups head to head, what you find is a quite significant 40% deficit in the

31
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:16,946
ability of the brain to make new memories without sleep. I think this should be

32
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:20,629
concerning considering what we know is happening to sleep in our education

33
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:26,332
populations right now. In fact, to put that in context, it would be the difference

34
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:33,050
in a child acing an exam versus failing it miserably, 40%. And we've gone on to

35
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:40,021
discover what goes wrong within your brain to produce these types of

36
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:44,688
learning disabilities. And there's a structure that sits on the left and the

37
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:47,634
right side of your brain called the hippocampus. And you can think of the

38
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:54,986
hippocampus almost like the informational inbox of your brain. It's very good at

39
00:03:54,665 --> 00:04:01,105
receiving new memory files and then holding on to them. And when you look at this

40
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:04,993
structure in those people who'd had a full night of sleep, we saw lots of

41
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:09,971
healthy learning-related activity. Yet in those people who were sleep deprived,

42
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:18,113
we actually couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever. So it's almost as

43
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:22,224
those sleep deprivation had shut down your memory inbox and any new incoming

44
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:29,003
files, they were just being bounced. You couldn't effectively commit new

45
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:35,250
experiences to memory. So that's the bad that can happen if I were to take

46
00:04:36,395 --> 00:04:40,715
sleep away from you, but let me just come back to that control group for a

47
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:46,150
second. Do you remember those folks that got a full eight hours of sleep? Well, we

48
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:50,024
can ask a very different question. What is it about the physiological quality of

49
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:56,317
your sleep when you do get it that restores and enhances your memory and

50
00:04:55,928 --> 00:05:01,528
learning ability each and every day? And by placing electrodes all over the head,

51
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:07,253
what we've discovered is that there are big powerful brainwaves that happen

52
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:11,808
during the very deepest stages of sleep that have riding on top of them, the

53
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:19,250
spectacular burst of electrical activity that we call sleep spindles. And it's

54
00:05:18,723 --> 00:05:24,403
the combined quality of these deep sleep brainwaves that acts like a file

55
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:29,535
transfer mechanism at night. Shifting memories from a short-term vulnerable

56
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:33,477
reservoir to a more permanent long-term storage site within the brain. And

57
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:40,970
therefore protecting them, making them safe. And it is important that we

58
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:48,926
understand what during sleep actually transacts these memory benefits because

59
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:52,814
there are real medical and societal implications. And let me just tell you about

60
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:58,004
one area that we've moved this work out into clinically, which is the

61
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:05,003
context of aging and dementia. Because it's, of course, no secret that as we

62
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:09,525
get older, our learning and memory abilities begin to fade and decline. But what

63
00:06:09,713 --> 00:06:15,953
we've also discovered is that a physiological signature of aging is that your

64
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:20,689
sleep gets worse, especially that deep quality of sleep that I was just

65
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:28,168
discussing. And only last year we finally published evidence that these two

66
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:32,990
things, they're not simply co-occurring. They are significantly interrelated.

67
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:38,703
And it suggests that the disruption of deep sleep is an under-appreciated

68
00:06:39,352 --> 00:06:44,872
factor that is contributing to cognitive decline or memory decline. In aging

69
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:50,005
and most recently we've discovered in Alzheimer's disease as well. Now I know

70
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:58,426
this is remarkably depressing news. It's in the mail. It's coming at you. But

71
00:06:56,594 --> 00:07:01,594
there's a potential silver lining here. Unlike many of the other factors that

72
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:07,654
we know are associated with aging. For example, changes in the physical

73
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:11,929
structure of the brain. That's fiendishly difficult to treat. But that sleep

74
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:18,376
is a missing piece in the explanatory puzzle of aging in Alzheimer's. Is

75
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:23,822
exciting because we may be able to do something about it. And one way that we

76
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:30,047
are approaching this at my sleep center is not by using sleeping pills, by the

77
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:32,533
way. Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments that do not produce

78
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:37,715
naturalistic sleep. Instead, we're actually developing a method based on this.

79
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:44,218
It's called direct current brain stimulation. You insert a small amount of

80
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:47,674
voltage into the brain. So small, you typically don't feel it. But it has a

81
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:54,923
measurable impact. Now, if you apply this stimulation during sleep in young

82
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:59,958
healthy adults, as if you're sort of singing in time with those deep sleep

83
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:07,941
brainwaves, not only can you amplify the size of those deep sleep brainwaves,

84
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:12,607
but in doing so, we can almost double the amount of memory benefit that you

85
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:18,499
get from sleep. The question now is whether we can translate the same

86
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:22,768
affordable, potentially portable piece of technology into older adults and

87
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:29,277
those with dementia. Can we restore back some healthy quality of deep sleep

88
00:08:29,544 --> 00:08:35,544
and in doing so, can we salvage aspects of their learning and memory function?

89
00:08:36,703 --> 00:08:45,343
That is my real hope now. That's one of our moon shot goals, as it were. So that's

90
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:51,378
an example of sleep for your brain, but sleep is just as essential for your body.

91
00:08:49,957 --> 00:08:55,597
We've already spoken about sleep loss and your reproductive system. Or I could

92
00:08:57,217 --> 00:09:02,737
tell you about sleep loss and your cardiovascular system and that all it takes

93
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:09,987
is one hour. Because there is a global experiment performed on 1.6 billion

94
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:16,127
people across 70 countries twice a year, and it's called Daylight Savings Time.

95
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:24,162
Now in the spring, when we lose one hour of sleep, we see a subsequent 24% increase

96
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:33,433
in heart attacks that following day. In the autumn, when we gain an hour of sleep,

97
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:40,949
we see a 21% reduction in heart attacks. Isn't that incredible? And you see

98
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:50,997
exactly the same profile for car crashes, road traffic accidents, even suicide rates.

99
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:57,700
But as a deeper dive, I want to focus on this sleep loss and your immune system. And here

100
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:04,249
I'll introduce these delightful blue elements in the image. They are called natural killer

101
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:09,559
cells. And you can think of natural killer cells almost like the secret service agents

102
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:16,673
of your immune system. And they are very good at identifying dangerous, unwanted elements

103
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:23,916
and eliminating them. In fact, what they're doing here is destroying a cancerous tumor mass.

104
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:33,851
So what you wish for is a virile set of these immune assassins at all times. And tragically

105
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:39,450
that's what you don't have if you're not sleeping enough. So here in this experiment, you're

106
00:10:38,717 --> 00:10:43,317
not going to have your sleep deprived for an entire night. You're simply going to have

107
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:51,289
your sleep restricted to four hours for one single night. And then we're going to look

108
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:55,855
to see what's the percent reduction in immune cell activity that you suffer. And it's

109
00:10:56,696 --> 00:11:07,696
not small, it's not 10%, it's not 20%, there was a 70% drop in natural killer cell activity.

110
00:11:06,825 --> 00:11:14,145
It's a concerning state of immune deficiency. And you can perhaps understand why we're

111
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:20,627
now finding significant links between short sleep duration and your risk for the development

112
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:27,943
of numerous forms of cancer. Currently that list includes cancer of the bowel, cancer

113
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:36,009
of the prostate, and cancer of the breast. In fact, the link between a lack of sleep and

114
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:44,011
cancer is now so strong that the World Health Organization has classified any form of night-time

115
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:52,841
shift work as a probable carcinogen because of a disruption of your sleep weight rhythms.

116
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:58,553
So you may have heard of that old maxim that you can sleep when you're dead. Well,

117
00:11:58,756 --> 00:12:06,116
I'm being quite serious now. It is mortally unwise advice. We know this from epidemiological

118
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:12,208
studies across millions of individuals. There's a simple truth. The shorter your sleep, the shorter

119
00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:20,828
your life. Short sleep predicts all cause mortality. And if increasing your risk for the development

120
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:31,920
of cancer or even Alzheimer's disease, we're not sufficiently disquieting. We have since discovered

121
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:41,010
that a lack of sleep will even erode the very fabric of biological life itself, your DNA

122
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:46,660
genetic code. So here in this study, they took a group of healthy adults and they limited

123
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:54,378
them to six hours of sleep a night for one week. And then they measured the change in their gene

124
00:12:53,950 --> 00:13:00,190
activity profile relative to when those same individuals were getting a full eight hours of sleep

125
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:09,601
a night. And there were two critical findings. First, a sizable and significant 711 genes were

126
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:18,291
distorted in their activity caused by a lack of sleep. The second result was that about half of those

127
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:23,023
genes were actually increased in their activity. The other half were decreased. Now, those genes that

128
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:30,769
were switched off by a lack of sleep were genes associated with your immune system. So once again,

129
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:37,148
you can see that immune deficiency. In contrast, those genes that were actually upregulated or

130
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:43,357
increased by way of a lack of sleep were genes associated with the promotion of tumors,

131
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:50,969
genes associated with long-term chronic inflammation within the body. And genes associated with

132
00:13:51,139 --> 00:14:00,179
stress and as a consequence, cardiovascular disease. There is simply no aspect of your wellness

133
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:05,290
that can retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation and get away unscathed. It's rather like a broken

134
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:11,823
water pipe in your home. Sleep loss will leak down into every nook and cranny of your physiology.

135
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:19,745
Even tempering with the very DNA nucleic alphabet, that spells out your daily health narrative.

136
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:31,221
And at this point, you may be thinking, oh my goodness, how do I start to get better sleep? What are

137
00:14:29,554 --> 00:14:37,794
your tips for good sleep? Well, beyond avoiding the damaging and harmful impact of alcohol and

138
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:43,210
caffeine on sleep. And if you're struggling with sleep at night avoiding naps during the day,

139
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:52,562
I have two pieces of advice for you. The first is regularity. Go to bed at the same time,

140
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:59,424
wake up at the same time. No matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend, regularity is king.

141
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:05,886
And it will anchor your sleep and improve the quantity and the quality of that sleep.

142
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:15,379
The second is keep it cool. Your body needs to drop its core temperature by about two to three

143
00:15:14,793 --> 00:15:21,513
degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep and then to stay asleep. And it's the reason you will always

144
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:28,290
find it easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot. So aim for a bedroom

145
00:15:27,145 --> 00:15:32,825
temperature of around 65 degrees or about 18 degrees Celsius. That's going to be optimal for the

146
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:42,703
sleep of most people. And then finally in taking a step back then, what is the mission critical

147
00:15:42,056 --> 00:15:51,336
statement here? Well, I think it may be this. Sleep unfortunately is not an optional lifestyle

148
00:15:51,992 --> 00:16:03,272
luxury. Sleep is a non-negotiable biological necessity. It is your life support system. And it

149
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:13,532
is Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality. And the decimation of sleep throughout industrialised

150
00:16:12,443 --> 00:16:20,203
nations is having a catastrophic impact on our health or wellness, even the safety and the education

151
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:28,132
of our children. It's a silent sleep loss epidemic and it is fast becoming one of the greatest

152
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:37,741
public health challenges that we face in the 21st century. I believe it is now time for us to

153
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:46,140
reclaim our right to a full night of sleep and without embarrassment or that unfortunate stigma

154
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:54,010
of laziness. And in doing so, we can be reunited with the most powerful elixir of life,

155
00:16:54,207 --> 00:17:03,547
the swiss army knife of health as it were. And with that soap box ran to over, I will simply say,

156
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:10,845
good night, good luck, and above all, I do hope you sleep well. Thank you very much indeed.

157
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:26,551
Thank you. Thank you so much. No, no, no, stay there for a second. Good job not running away,

158
00:17:25,304 --> 00:17:30,104
though. I appreciate that. That was terrifying. You're welcome. Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

159
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:38,992
Since we can't catch up on sleep, what are we supposed to do? What do we do when we're like

160
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:44,153
tossing and turning in bed late at night or doing shift work or whatever else? So you're right,

161
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:50,667
we can't catch up on sleep. Sleep is not like the bank. You can't accumulate a debt and then

162
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:55,624
hope to pay it off at a later point in time. I should also note the reason that it's so catastrophic

163
00:17:57,556 --> 00:18:03,556
that our health deteriorates so quickly. First is because human beings are the only species that

164
00:18:03,653 --> 00:18:10,773
deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent reason. As we're smart. And I make that

165
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:14,218
point because what it means is that mother nature throughout the course of evolution has never had

166
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:23,620
to face the challenge of this thing called sleep deprivation. So she's never developed a safety net.

167
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:30,256
And that's why when you under sleep, things just sort of implode so quickly both within the

168
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:37,055
brain and the body. So you just have to prioritize. Okay. So but tossing and turning in bed,

169
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:44,842
what do I do? So if you are staying in bed awake for too long, you should get out of bed and go to

170
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:48,742
a different room and do something different. The reason is because your brain will very quickly

171
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:54,076
associate your bedroom with the place of wakefulness. And you need to break that association.

172
00:18:54,696 --> 00:19:00,136
So only return to bed when you are sleepy. And that way you will relearn the association that

173
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:07,887
you once had, which is your bed is the place of sleep. So the analogy would be you'd never sit at

174
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:12,375
the dinner table waiting to get hungry. So why would you lie in bed waiting to get sleepy?

175
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:17,344
All right. Well, thank you for that wake-up call. Great job, Matt.

176
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:19,396
Very welcome. Thank you very much.
